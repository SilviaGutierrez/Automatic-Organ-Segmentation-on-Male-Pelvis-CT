# Automatic-Organ-Segmentation-on-Male-Pelvis-CT
This repository shows two models developed in Matlab for organs segmentation on male pelvis CT images using deep learning technique. A model was trained to segment only the prostate while another one was trained to segment the prostate, bladder, and rectum. In both models, the used architecture was DeepLabv3+ with ResNet18 as encoder. 100 radiotherapy planning CT scans from 100 patients were used for training and network validation. A 10-fold cross-validation strategy was carried out to assess the generalizability of the models, and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was employed to assess the segmentation performance by comparing the automatic segmentation to the manually physician-generated contours. In the 10-fold cross-validation strategy, averages DSCs of 87.8±7.0% whereas averages DSCs of 74.7±16.1%, 81.6±13.8%, and 83.8±13.2% were achieved for the automatic segmentation of the prostate, bladder, and rectum, respectively.
